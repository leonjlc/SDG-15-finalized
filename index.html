            The sustainable development goal number 15 shows the need to protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of ecosystems for a healthier world. 
            If we manage to implement these goals, we can manage to preserve extinction and ensure long lasting natural habitats. Together these goals represent a way to secure the 
            planets environments, making sure that the problems remain silent and wont come back for the next generations.

            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Biodiversity Loss</h3>
                <p>
                    Biodiversity is in decline at an unprecedented rate, with species extinction rates accelerating due to habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and overexploitation. The loss of biodiversity threatens ecosystem services that are vital for human survival, including food security, clean water, and disease regulation. SDG 15 aims to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by promoting the conservation of ecosystems and protecting endangered species.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                <p>
                    Forests and other terrestrial ecosystems play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by sequestering carbon dioxide. Deforestation and land degradation release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, promoting global warming. By promoting sustainable forest management and land restoration, SDG 15 contributes to climate change mitigation and helps build resilience against climate impacts.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Sustainable Land Use</h3>
                <p>
                    Land degradation, driven by unsustainable agricultural practices, urbanization, and industrial activities, affects over a quarter of the world's land area. This degradation reduces the land's productivity, undermining food security and livelihoods, particularly for vulnerable communities. SDG 15 advocates for the sustainable use of land resources, combatting desertification, and striving for a land degradation-neutral world.
                </p>

            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Human Health and Well-being</h3>
                    <p>
                        Healthy terrestrial ecosystems are essential for human health and well-being. They provide clean air, water, and fertile soil, and support a diverse array of plant and animal life that contributes to medical discoveries and natural remedies. By ensuring the protection and sustainable management of these ecosystems, SDG 15 supports overall human health and quality of life.

            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Socioeconomic Benefits</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many communities, particularly indigenous peoples, rely directly on forests and other ecosystems for their livelihoods, cultural practices, and identities. Protecting and restoring these ecosystems not only preserves biodiversity but also supports economic development, poverty reduction, and the preservation of cultural heritage.

                <h3>Global Cooperation and Policy Integration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Achieving SDG 15 requires global cooperation and the integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning. This goal encourages countries to adopt policies and practices that promote sustainable development and ensure that the benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services are equitably shared.

                    <p class="groesser">
                        In today's context, SDG 15 is more relevant than ever. It addresses the interconnectedness of environmental health, economic stability, and human well-being. By focusing on the protection, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, SDG 15 provides a comprehensive framework for tackling some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Its successful implementation is crucial for ensuring a sustainable and resilient future for all.

            <p>Since this answer is not very detailed, we would like to answer that question!<br>
            We ourselves think that individuals can reduce their consumption such as stop using non-renewable energy sources or stop burning wood to keep oneself warm.<br>
            Regarding Communities, they can try and educate their community about the SDG 15 and try to find things to do together like plant trees.<br>
            Lastly what governments could do is enforce policies like prohibiting mass deforestation or forcing chopped down trees to be replanted.</p>

            The Wilhelmsgymnasium Kassel has had its own environmental committee since 2019, in which they try to make everyday tasks as environmentally friendly as possible. This involves: mobility (explaining how good bicycles are), campaigns and projects (waste separation, upcycling competition, clothing swap campaign), awareness of more sustainability for younger classes and public relations (getting as much attention as possible). The team, made up of 30 students and 6 teachers, meets twice a year to exchange ideas about projects all day long. Due to all of our projects, our school was recognized as an environmental school for the first time in autumn 2020 and for the second time in 2022.
